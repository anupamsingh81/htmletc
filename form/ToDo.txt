*** phpAddEdit To Do List ***
*****************************

--- added id tags for each form field, same as the field name (addedit-form-fields.php)
--- Right now if you are editing a form there is code in the addedit-render.php file to loop through any 
	specified CSS files and include them. These won't be included in your <head></head> area though so 
	technically it violates W3C standards. It works fine but to get true HTML code compliance I need to 
	think of a better way to fix this or maybe just make it the responsibility of users to include their 
	CSS files? 
--- Skip fields: currently, if you want to skip a field you have to use the addedit-customize.php file to 
	specify it; I should add options in a form creation screen (step) to specify fields to skip for adding
	or editing scenarios.
--- Right now the password form field requires a confirmation; the script is setup to make that optional 
	via a variable called $password_confirm, but I don't offer that as an option to see in the steps proces;
	maybe I should add it? 
--- add a selectbox_other field that isn't AJAX enabled (like originally had); add ability to limit the # 
	of items that can be added in an AJAX selectbox_other box and/or add a captcha feature so bots can't submit
--- I have come across occasional problems with PHP differentiating between a value of zero (0) and boolean 
	false; it may crop up again for cases I haven't yet tested so need to keep that in mind...
--- allow options for specifying different emails for submission and editing
--- add AJAX auto suggestion (ref: http://www.dynamicajax.com/fr/AJAX_Suggest_Tutorial-271_290_312.html)
